# Web App
A simple web application for a shoe checkout system. It is created using React JS for front end, Bootstrap for responsive design and Node Js for our backend. 

To use the app, users can type how many of each item they want in the textboxes. Then, they can decide if they want to use a promo code (“yes”) for 50% off their subtotal. They have the option of including 13% tax as well. Finally, once they are satisfied they can click submit to view their total on the next page! To start a new session please refresh the page.
# Instructions
First clone the repository. NOTE: I accidentally pushed the node_modules to our repository so please run npm install in both the client and server folders.

In one terminal, cd into the server directory and run npm start. In a separate terminal, cd into client and run npm start. You should be able to see the app by accessing http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

To run unit tests, cd into the server folder and run npm test. This will look for the test folder and run our very simple unit test for the calculateTotal function.

# Frontend
For the frontend of our web app, we considered three options: React, Angular and Vue. React.js is considered to be more simpler front-end frameworks (according to a poll on stack overflow). It is extremely useful for repeated elements (ex/ create one custom component and customize it) which will result in cleaner and more modular code. On the other hand angular is considered to be harder to learn than React and Vue as it is based on typescript. React and Vue also lets us use JSX which can be easier to use with prior knowledge of HTML/CSS.

React was developed by Facebook in 2013 but now is an open source library. It is itself a JS library. It is considered a great option for single page applications as larger applications would need additional libraries. Angular was developed by Google in 2009 and is a full fledged framework. Vue was created in 2014 so it is still relatively new compared to the other options and therefore has less users. It also uses a Virtual DOM.

All three are JavaScript frameworks and can all be used to create user interfaces for web applications. With additional libraries, we can even build mobile apps ex/ React Native, Ionic or native script.

With over 100 000 stars on GItHub, it is fair to say that React.js (74.5 %) is considered to be one of the most loved frameworks among users (according to a poll on stack overflow  2019) compared to Angular (57%) and Vue (73%). More people choose React due to its virtual DOM.

As for speed and scalability, React’s virtual DOM ensures faster performance. Angular is more complex in terms of structure and can tend to lag at times. This is due to the fact that its DOM is real time. Vue is similar to React.

In Summary, we think React and Vue have a lot more pros than Angular for our simple web app. Evidently we chose React as we had prior experience with it making our job a little bit easier. It is also a lot more popular for jobs nowadays, so using it now will be very benificial.
