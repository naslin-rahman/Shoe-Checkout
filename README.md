# Web App
A simple web application for a shoe checkout system. It is created using React JS for front end, Bootstrap for responsive design and Node Js for our backend. 

To use the app, users can type how many of each item they want in the textboxes. Then, they can decide if they want to use a promo code (“yes”) for 50% off their subtotal. They have the option of including 13% tax as well. Finally, once they are satisfied they can click submit to view their total on the next page! To start a new session please refresh the page.
# Instructions
First clone the repository. NOTE: I accidentally pushed the node_modules to our repository so please run npm install in both the client and server folders.

In one terminal, cd into the server directory and run npm start. In a separate terminal, cd into client and run npm start. You should be able to see the app by accessing http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
